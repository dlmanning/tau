//! Fleet event bus: child→manager event forwarding and child→parent
//! interaction routing.
//!
//! Subagents broadcast events on their own [`AgentEvent`] channel. The
//! bus spawns a forwarder task per spawn that translates each event
//! into a [`FleetEvent`] (`Forwarded`, or `AgentReport` for self-labels)
//! and posts it on the manager's fleet channel.
//!
//! Subagents that emit `InteractionRequest`s (e.g. via `AskUserQuestion`
//! tools) send them on a per-spawn `mpsc` channel. The bus drains
//! that channel, stamps `agent_id`, and forwards to the parent's
//! interaction channel — so root-level UI sees a flat stream of
//! requests tagged with their originating agent.

/// Shutdown protocol: callers should signal `shutdown` and then `await`
/// the returned `JoinHandle` rather than `abort()`-ing it. On shutdown,
/// the forwarder enters a synchronous drain loop (`try_recv`) and
/// flushes every event already buffered in the broadcast receiver
/// before exiting. This closes a race where the actor emits a final
/// `TurnEnd` / `ToolExecutionEnd` (e.g. the closing turn of
/// `prompt_and_wait`) milliseconds before the lifecycle proceeds to
/// teardown: an immediate `abort()` would drop those buffered events
/// and the registry's `usage` / `tool_use_count` would systematically
/// under-count the final turn.
///
/// Before wrapping, the forwarder inspects each event for fleet
/// bookkeeping:
///   - `TurnEnd { usage, .. }` is accumulated onto the agent's
///     registry entry via [`Registry::record_turn_end`].
///   - `ToolExecutionEnd { .. }` increments the per-agent tool counter
///     via [`Registry::record_tool_use`]. Both errored and successful
///     tool calls are counted (the tool *was* invoked). See
///     [`Registry::record_tool_use`] for the semantic relationship
///     with `SubagentResult.tool_use_count`.
///
/// The registry handle is optional so headless test paths can skip
/// bookkeeping; in normal fleet flows it is always present.
